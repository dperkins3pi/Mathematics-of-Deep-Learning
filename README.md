This repository contains various labs from MATH 522, a course on the mathematics of Deep Learning at BYU. The most significant work is the file Paper_DeepQLearning.pdf (with the corresponding code at MathematicsOfDeepQLearning.ipynb). In this project, I worked in a group of 3 to better understand the effects of the epsilon decay schedules and prioritized experience replay in deep Q-learning algorithms.

**Research Project Abstract**

The application of deep learning in reinforcement learning has produced big breakthroughs in this field of ML. We explore how DQN improves Q-learning as well as see how two components of DQN impact its performace. Our results show that DQN can produce significantly better results than Q-learning when the components are adapted properly to the RL problem
